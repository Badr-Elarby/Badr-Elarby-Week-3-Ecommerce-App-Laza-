Laza is a stylish and modern e-commerce mobile application built with Flutter. It provides a seamless shopping experience for users to browse, favorite, and purchase fashion products. The app features a clean user interface, robust state management, and a feature-rich, scalable architecture.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration flow with email and password. Session management is handled using access and refresh tokens, with automatic token renewal via a Dio interceptor.
- **Personalized Onboarding:** A gender selection screen to tailor the initial product discovery experience.
- **Product Discovery:**
    - **Home Screen:** Displays a curated list of products.
    - **Brand Filtering:** Easily filter products by popular brands like Adidas, Nike, Fila, and Puma.
    - **Search:** A functional search bar to quickly find items.
- **Product Details:** A comprehensive detail screen for each product, showcasing multiple images, description, price, ratings, and stock availability.
- **Favorites / Wishlist:** Users can "like" products and save them to a persistent favorites list for later viewing.
- **Shopping Cart:** A fully functional shopping cart where users can add items, update quantities, remove items, and view a summary of their order before proceeding to checkout.
- **Order Confirmation:** A confirmation screen to notify the user that their order has been placed successfully.
- **Declarative Routing:** A clean and maintainable navigation system built with `go_router`, including a shell route for the main screens with a persistent bottom navigation bar.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This project follows a clean, feature-first architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Architecture:** Feature-based layered architecture (`data`, `presentation`).
- **State Management:** `flutter_bloc` / `Cubit` for predictable and reactive state management.
- **Dependency Injection:** `get_it` for managing dependencies and decoupling components.
- **Networking:** `dio` for handling HTTP requests, with a custom interceptor for handling authentication and token refreshes.
- **Routing:** `go_router` for a robust, declarative navigation system.
- **Local Storage:**
  - `flutter_secure_storage` for securely persisting authentication tokens.
  - `shared_preferences` for storing user preferences like favorites, cart items, and gender selection.
- **UI:**
  - `flutter_screenutil` for creating responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes.
  - `google_fonts` for custom typography.
  - `flutter_animate` and `shimmer` for engaging animations and loading effects.
- **Utilities:** `equatable` for simplifying model comparisons.
